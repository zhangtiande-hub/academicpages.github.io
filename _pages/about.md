I am currently a Master's student at Northeastern University, supervised by Dr. Qi Shouliang (http://www.bmie.neu.edu.cn/2016/0615/c8375a1408/page.htm). I will soon pursue a joint Ph.D. program between Harbin Institute of Technology and the Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Dr. Zhao Yitian(https://ytianzhao.github.io/) and Dr. Luo Gongning(https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/luogongning).
